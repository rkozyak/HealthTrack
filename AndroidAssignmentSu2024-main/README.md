In this assignment will be completing the implmentation of a basic flashcard app by filling in 7 different TODOs represting missing parts of a fully functionaly app. 

The app will have three Activities, `MainMenuActivity`, `CreateFlashcardActivity`, and `QuizActivity.` These act as a navbar, flashcard configuration, and quiz tool, repsectively.

The project folder contains 7 TODOs in 5 different files:

`MainMenuActivity.java` contains TODO 1

`FlashcardManagerSingleton.java` contains TODO 2

`CreateFlashcardActivity.java` contains TODO 3

`activity_main_menu.xml` contains TODO 4

`QuizActiviety.java` contains TODOs 5,6

`ExampleUnitTest.java` contains TODO 7


Note that some of the TODOs (particulary the ones implementing Intents and Bundles) are dependedent on the implmentation in both of the Activities

Although it is not essential, you may want consider doing these TODOs in order as the concepts are somewhat sequential.

Please refer to the Android Tutorial videos posted to Canvas for implementation tips.

Here is a video displaying the correct functionality of the app that you should strive for: https://youtu.be/7W5fP5BaNwU
